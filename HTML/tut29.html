    RESPONSIVE DESIGN — COMPLETE NOTES
    ================================

    RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN (RWD):
    Responsive design is a technique that allows a website to adapt
    automatically to different screen sizes, devices, and resolutions.

    WHY RESPONSIVE DESIGN IS IMPORTANT:
    1. There are endless devices and screen sizes.
    2. Designing separately for each device is impossible.
    3. Responsive design is a necessity, not a luxury.

    CORE PILLARS OF RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
    1. Viewport meta tag
    2. Flexible layouts (%, vw, vh)
    3. Responsive units (em, rem)
    4. CSS Media Queries

<html lang="en">
<!-- Root element of the document, language set to English -->

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- Ensures proper character rendering -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- 
        VIEWPORT META TAG (VERY IMPORTANT)
        - width=device-width → page width equals device width
        - initial-scale=1.0 → default zoom level
        Without this, responsive layouts break on mobile devices

            RESPONSIVE UNITS SUMMARY:

            px  → fixed (not responsive)
            %   → relative to parent
            vw  → viewport width (1vw = 1% of screen width)
            vh  → viewport height (1vh = 1% of screen height)
            em  → relative to parent font size
            rem → relative to root font size (recommended)

            BEST PRACTICE:
            - Use rem for font sizes
            - Use % / vw / vh for layout
            - Avoid fixed widths and heights

    FINAL REVISION NOTES
    ================================

    RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
    A method to make websites work on all devices.

    VIEWPORT:
    Controls page scaling on mobile devices.

    MEDIA QUERIES:
    Apply styles conditionally based on screen size.

    REM UNITS:
    Scale consistently across devices.

    BEST PRACTICES:
    ✔ Use max-width instead of fixed width
    ✔ Avoid fixed heights
    ✔ Use Flexbox/Grid for layout
    ✔ Always test on mobile view

    INTERVIEW ONE-LINER:
    Responsive design adapts layouts to different devices using flexible units,
    viewport meta tag, and media queries.
